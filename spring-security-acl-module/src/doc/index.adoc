== About the SpringSecurityAclModule
The `SpringSecurityAclModule` enables Access Control Lists for managing permissions.  The core service for working
with the ACLs is the `AclSecurityService` and supports management of ACLs attached to `IdBasedEntity` instances,
seamlessly integrating with other standard modules.

=== Default parent ACL
The `AclSecurityService` optionally allows setting a default parent ACL (in the form of the `IdBasedEntity`
that owns the ACL).  The default parent is attached to any newly created ACL that does not have an explicit parent
specified.

=== ACL security entities
The `SpringSecurityAclModule` packs a domain model for ACL security entities.  These are abstract database entities
that serve no other purpose than attaching an ACL to them.  They optionally take another security entity as parent,
whose ACL will then also be the parent ACL.

The ACL security entity hierarchy exactly represents the backing ACL hierarchy.  ACL security entities are usually
only developer managed and by default require the *acl take ownership* permissions to manage them through the
administrative interface.

The standard `UserModule` provides a default installation of security entities, and sets the *system* security entity
for the default parent ACL.

=== Global permissions
The `SpringSecurityAclModule` defines 3 global permissions, these are available as constants in the `AclAuthorities` interface.
